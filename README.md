#### Here are a couple of issues I ran into
 - the first was the footer, I could not figure out how to stick it to the bottom of the page. 
  - I was able to google a way to apply a flex box to the body then set the footer to margin top auto that always pushes it away from the bottom of the card item.
- The next problem I ran into was trying to stick the button in the cards to the bottom of the card, I tried taking it out of the text-box flex container and putting it inside the section but I still could't figure out how to make it flex with the other items and stay at the bottom.
